TPO [mafia]

[the time setting is set in the 1990 with the children being around the age 8-12]

deep in the forest, amongst the pinewood trees, was an orphanage. a small community living a solitude life under one roof. 
that was until one day.


The Pinewood Orphanage is a small community or "family" set in the far land of the pinewood forest. Mother rosary, the sole caretaker of the children, 
is a strict, yet a gentle mother figure for them. Despite all not having her blood, she raises them like her own.  

One particular night, a child goes missing. everyone was frantic. except for her, mother rosary. she showed deep concern at first,
but turned indifferent a bit too quickly. 

Night after night, more children goes missing. Until one afternoon, a body was found dead, rotting within the bushes. 
it was the first child that goes missing that one night. Mother rosary had acted as if she was blind, but the children weren't dumb 
neither. they have to act fast before more innocent lives were killed. it couldn't be mother rosary herself, she was out of the house one night,
and yet, the massacre keeps on going. it must be one of them, something is mimicking to be an innocent child. Quick, they must
eliminate the blood thirsty mimic.
